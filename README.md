This is a directory containing the code I used for my project entitled "Important Groups First: Encouraging Disentanglement in Variational Autoencoders"

Abstract:
Machine learning models represent data as vectors for a variety of tasks. Creating
vector representations that are disentangled—where every dimension in the vector
represents one human-interpretable aspect of the data—has been gaining interest re-
cently. Disentangled representations allow these models to be more easily understood
and diagnosed. We experiment with a modification to the Variational Autoencoder
(VAE), the state-of-the-art model for disentanglement, to encourage it to store in-
formation more important in representing an image in certain dimensions. We hope
to mitigate two common issues with VAEs: that they are inconsistent in perform-
ing disentanglement, and that disentanglement often comes at the cost of quality of
recovering images from their representations. Our method proves competitive to ex-
isting methods, with similar results in terms of disentanglement consistency and the
tradeoff between image quality and disentanglement.
